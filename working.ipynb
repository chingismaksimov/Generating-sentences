    "This is an introductory post about genetic algorithms (GAs) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm), which are a suite of methods of solving optimization problems. GAs form a subset of more general evolutionary algorithms (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm). As the name implies, these algorithms are based on evolution-inspired methods, like mutation, crossover, survival of the fittest, to achieve an optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do genetic algorithms work? Generally speaking, GAs work by creating a *population* of possible solutions, called individuals or phenotypes, and letting them *evolve* until an optimal solution to a given problem has been obtained. As the first step, the algorithm starts off with the first generation of randomly created phenotypes, where each individual phenotype has a set of properties that can be easily altered. Think of these individual solutions as of sequences of DNA. At the end of each generation, each individual solution is being evaluated and gets assigned a fitness score. Now, using these scores, the next generation is created by means of crossover, i.e. when two *parent* solutions are taken and their *genes* are exchanged, and mutation - the process by which any given gene in the phenotype can be randomly changed. More fit solutions have higher chances of being picked for subsequent crossover and thus have a higher probability of passing on their genes to the next generation. This process repeats until the optimal solution is achieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "GAs provide a number of benefits over more traditional approaches to optimization problems, like conceptual simplicity, broad applicability, self-optimization. Furthermore, real-life problems usually suffer from nonlinear constraints and non-stationarity that make classical optimization techniques less effective. Fogel (1997) provides a very good overview of other benefits associated with GAs. Over the years, EAs and GAs have found applications in a variety of fields(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_genetic_algorithm_applications).\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to demonstrate the main steps of genetic algorithms by making our Python program generate a prespecified string. In other words, given a target string of length *n*, we would like to use GA method to generate this target string by means of mutation, crossover and selection from a randomly generated initial population. This example, even though very simple, utilizes all the main components of GA algorithms. \n",

Finally, note that, for each generation, we also identify the best performing solution. We do this so that any subsequent generation includes the fittest solution from the preceding generation. This way we are making sure that our population is never regressing and subsequent generations achieve at least the same score as the one preceding. \n",
